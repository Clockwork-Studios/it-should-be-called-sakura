# It Should Be Called Sakura

A no-frills modification that simply renames the "Cherry" wood type to "Sakura." This dead simple resource pack literally just gives a different name to the existing wood type. Don't expect any fancy visuals or dramatic changes here. It's a straightforward switch that swaps out "Cherry" for "Sakura".

Works with the following languages:
- `English (US)`
- `English (Australia)`
- `English (Canada)`
- `English (United Kingdom)`
- `English (New Zealand)`
- `ɥsᴉlƃuƎ (uʍop ǝpᴉsd∩)`

Note that `LOLCAT (Kingdom of Cats)` has the change in vanilla.
